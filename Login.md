### My Solution Flowchart
1. There is two input fields (username and password) for login. I have tried to login something random but it didnâ€™t work.

2. I visited the page and opened network tab to see all files. HTML and CSS files contained nothing special but there is something interesting in JS file.

3. Seems like the code compare the input after converting to Base64 string. So, I have to just decode the comparison text to normal string.

4. I copied the base64 string from the condition part and used atob function to decode it.
